Parent Involvement Committees and school councils provide a voice
that reflects the diversity of parents in their communities.

Provide parents with the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to
support student learning at home and at school.

Many current policies, programs, and initiatives reflect and support this
strategy, as illustrated by the following selected examples:

• The Parent Engagement Office of the Ministry of Education continues to
build awareness among parents of the importance of parent engagement.

• The ministry website and ministry publications provide in-depth
information on the education system as well as a wide variety of tools
and resources, including tips for parent-teacher conversations, to help
parents foster student learning at home.

What are the parents involvement? “Parents Matter”, a Ministry of Education brochure on parent
engagement, and how parent engagement is building student success,
is available in multiple languages on the ministry’s website.
